<h1>Problem Tackling</h1>

Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders and occurs with an incidence of 68.8/100,000  person-years. 
The age-adjusted incidence of epilepsy is estimated to be 44/100,000 person-years.  
Despite the introduction of new antiepileptic drugs in the last decades, one-third of people with epilepsy  
continue to have seizures despite treatment.  
However, even when seizures are well controlled, self-reported quality of life is significantly lowered by the  
anxiety associated with the unpredictable nature of seizures and the consequences therefrom. 
Some of the  difficulties in managing treatment-refractory epilepsy can be ameliorated by the ability 
to detect clinical  seizures.   This information might be useful both in developing accurate seizure diaries 
and in providing therapies during  times of greatest seizure susceptibility. The ability to rapidly and accurately 
detect seizures could promote  therapies aimed at rapidly treating seizures. The capability to detect seizures early and 
anticipate their onset  prior to presentation would provide even greater advantages. These early detection and prediction s
ystems  might be able to abort seizures through targeted therapies. Such systems would also be able to prevent  
accidents and limit injury. 

<h1>Solution</h1>

Typically seizures are detected by analyzing the electroencephalogram (EEG), but obtaining it outside the  
hospital is too difficult for long-term monitoring. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is however easily  obtainable in a 
home environment. Earlier studies showed that most tonic-clonic (TC) seizures are  accompanied by a specific heart rate (HR) pattern.    
This project was started as our  2nd year semester project of the Computer Science and Engineering  Department, 
the University of Moratuwa in February 2019. The device with EEG was designed by us under   
Dr Shantha Fernando (Consultant Neurologist).     

Our target is to build a portable 4-channel EEG along with heart rate sensor  So the final project will be a     

“Low-cost wearable device to identify Tonic-clonic seizure using 4 channel EEG and heartbeat” 




<h2>Background</h2>
There are devices in the market which detects seizure like Nightwatch which is based on non-EEG devices.  These competitive devices 
are based on ECG or heartbeat pattern. One key disadvantage of the Nightwatch device is as it is a non-EEG device, the false 
positive rate is very  high. Even for cold or after a long run your heart rate pattern can be identified as a seizure pattern. 
The only  way to detect tonic-clonic seizure is to use an EEG device.  
The key advantage of our device is that it is has a portable 4-channel EEG device which is specially  designed 
for tonic-clonic seizure. This device will detect and Inform people nearby and also parents.
